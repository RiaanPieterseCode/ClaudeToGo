# üì± ClaudeToGo - Mobile Notifications System PRD

## ‚ö†Ô∏è IMPLEMENTATION ASSESSMENT

**STATUS**: üü° FUNCTIONAL - Some setup issues need attention for smooth deployment

### Implementation Considerations
- **Node.js Compatibility**: Setup may conflict with existing Node.js versions
- **Missing PWA Assets**: Critical icon files missing - will cause deployment failures
- **Directory Safety**: Scripts may overwrite existing projects without backup
- **Standard Dependencies**: Requires external services (Supabase, Netlify, GitHub)

**RECOMMENDATION**: Use manual setup in isolated directory, check Node.js compatibility first.

## üéØ Product Overview

### Vision Statement
ClaudeToGo enables seamless mobile notifications for Claude Code users, allowing developers to receive real-time alerts when tasks complete or require input, eliminating the need to monitor terminal sessions actively.

**Current Status**: ‚ö†Ô∏è Functional prototype with significant implementation risks requiring remediation

### Target Users
- **Primary**: Linux developers using Claude Code for extended/automated tasks
- **Secondary**: Remote developers who step away from workstations during long-running operations

### Business Objectives
- Improve developer productivity by reducing idle waiting time
- Enhance Claude Code user experience through proactive notifications
- Enable confident delegation of long-running tasks to Claude Code

### Success Metrics
- 80%+ notification delivery success rate within 30 seconds
- 90%+ user satisfaction with notification timeliness
- 50%+ reduction in time spent monitoring Claude Code sessions

## üë• User Personas

### Persona 1: The Busy Developer
- **Role**: Senior Software Engineer
- **Pain Point**: Starts Claude Code tasks, gets pulled into meetings, forgets to check progress
- **Need**: Reliable mobile alerts when tasks finish or need input

### Persona 2: The Remote Worker
- **Role**: Freelance Developer
- **Pain Point**: Works from coffee shops, can't keep terminal open while stepping away
- **Need**: Secure notifications that don't expose sensitive information

## ‚ú® Feature Requirements

### P0 (Must Have)
- **F1**: Real-time notification delivery to mobile devices
- **F2**: Secure authentication and data transmission
- **F3**: Integration with Claude Code hooks system
- **F4**: Support for task completion and input-required events

### P1 (Should Have)
- **F5**: Message filtering to prevent sensitive data exposure
- **F6**: Offline PWA functionality
- **F7**: Notification history and persistence
- **F8**: Multiple device support

### P2 (Nice to Have)
- **F9**: Custom notification sounds/vibration patterns
- **F10**: Rich notification content with task context
- **F11**: Notification scheduling/quiet hours

## üîÑ User Flows

### Primary Flow: Task Completion Notification
1. Developer starts Claude Code task on Linux laptop
2. Developer steps away from workstation
3. Claude Code completes task and triggers hook
4. System sends authenticated API request to Supabase
5. PWA receives real-time update via Supabase channels
6. Browser/PWA triggers native push notification
7. Developer receives mobile notification and returns to workstation

### Secondary Flow: Input Required Notification
1. Claude Code encounters decision point requiring user input
2. Hook triggers with "Notification" event
3. System sends priority notification to mobile device
4. Developer receives alert and returns to provide input

## üîß Technical Requirements

### üîß Technical Requirements

**Implementation Needs**:
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Missing PWA assets (icons) - critical for deployment
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Node.js compatibility checks needed
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Directory safety mechanisms for setup scripts
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Git repository safety checks

**Standard Practices**:
- ‚úÖ Environment variables for credential storage (developer standard)
- ‚úÖ HTTPS API communications
- ‚úÖ Input validation for user content
- ‚úÖ Error handling for API failures

### Non-Functional Requirements
- **Security**: All API communications over HTTPS with authentication + secure credential management
- **Performance**: <30 second notification delivery time
- **Reliability**: 99.5% uptime for notification service + graceful degradation for service outages
- **Privacy**: No sensitive data in notification content + content filtering
- **Environment Safety**: No conflicts with existing development setups
- **Deployment Resilience**: Ability to recover from failed installations

### Technical Specifications
- **Backend**: Supabase (PostgreSQL + Real-time + Auth)
- **Frontend**: PWA deployed on Netlify (requires missing asset implementation)
- **Integration**: Claude Code hooks with curl commands (requires validation and security hardening)
- **Authentication**: Supabase Auth with JWT tokens (requires secure token storage)
- **Credential Management**: Secure storage solution (NOT shell environment variables)

### System Architecture

## üìä Analytics & Monitoring

### Key Metrics to Track
- Notification delivery time (target: <30s)
- Hook execution success rate (target: >95%)
- User engagement with notifications (click-through rate)
- Authentication failures and security events

### Monitoring Requirements
- Supabase function execution logs
- API response times and error rates
- PWA service worker performance
- Push notification delivery confirmations

## üöÄ Release Planning

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Phase 0: Setup Improvements (RECOMMENDED BEFORE MVP)
- **Asset Creation**: Create missing PWA icons for proper deployment
- **Environment Safety**: Add Node.js compatibility checks and backup mechanisms
- **Directory Safety**: Improve script safety for existing projects
- **Git Safety**: Add repository status checks before deployment
- **User Guidance**: Improve setup documentation and troubleshooting

### Phase 1: Secure MVP (Week 1-2)
- Basic Supabase setup with notifications table
- Simple PWA with auth and real-time subscriptions (with proper assets)
- Claude Code hooks configuration (with security validation)
- Core notification delivery (with secure credential handling)

### Phase 2: Security & Polish (Week 3)
- Message filtering implementation
- Enhanced error handling and rollback capabilities
- Notification history UI
- **Security Review**: Comprehensive security audit
- Documentation and **safe** setup guides

### Phase 3: Advanced Features (Week 4+)
- Multi-device support
- Custom notification preferences
- Performance optimizations
- User feedback integration
- **Production Hardening**: Final security and stability improvements

## ‚ùì Open Questions & Assumptions

### Questions
1. Should we support group notifications for team environments?
2. What's the ideal notification retention period?
3. How should we handle notification rate limiting?

### Assumptions
- Users have modern browsers supporting PWA and Push API
- Supabase free tier sufficient for initial user base
- Users comfortable storing auth tokens in environment variables

## üîí Security Considerations

ClaudeToGo follows standard developer security practices:

### Data Protection
- Environment variables for credential storage (developer standard)
- Message content filtering to prevent sensitive data exposure
- Row-level security (RLS) in Supabase
- HTTPS-only communication
- CTG_ prefix to prevent environment variable conflicts

### Developer Security Context
**Important**: ClaudeToGo security depends on your laptop security. If someone has access to your development machine, they already have access to:
- All your development credentials and API keys
- Your logged-in services (GitHub, AWS, email, etc.)
- Claude Code itself (which has broad system access)
- Your IDE and project files

### Best Practices
- Keep your laptop encrypted and locked when away
- Use strong login credentials and 2FA where possible
- Keep your system updated
- Input sanitization for notification content
- Rate limiting on API endpoints
- Regular credential rotation (when practical)
